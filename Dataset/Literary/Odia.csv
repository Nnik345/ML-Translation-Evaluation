"स्याम! मने चाकर राखो जी,
गिरधारिलाल! चाकर राखो जी॥

चाकर रह सूँ बाग लगा सूँ, नित उठ दरसण पासूँ।
बिंद्राबन की कुंजगलिन में, तेरी लीला गासूँ॥

चाकरी में दरसण पाऊँ, सुमिरन पाऊँ खरची।
भाव भगति जागीरी पाऊँ, तीनूँ बाताँ सरसी॥

मोर मुगट पीतांबर सोहे, गल बैजंती माला।
बिंद्राबन में धेनु चरावे, मोहन मुरली वाला॥

हरे हरे नित बाग लगाऊँ, बिच बिच राखूँ क्यारी।
साँवरिया के दरसण पाऊँ, पहर कुसुम्मी सारी॥

जोगी आया जोग करण कूँ, तप करणे संन्यासी।
हरि भजन कूँ साधु आयो, बिंद्राबन के बासी॥

मीरा के प्रभु गहिर गंभीरा, सदा रहो जी धीरा।
आधी रात प्रभु दरसन दीन्हें, प्रेम नदी के तीरा॥","Shyaam! Let me be your servant   - Meera
Shyaam! Let me be your servant,
Giridhaarilaal! Let me be your servant.
I will be your servant
I will plant a garden for you
I will wake up every day to admire your darshan
In the green alleys of Brindaban, I will sing about your leelas-
your childish plays.
While I serve you,
I will be rewarded with your blissful darshan,
To chant your name, will be my pay
To be your devoted Bhakt, 
 will be my Jaagir, my estate
All three of these are good.
Adorned by a crown of peacock feathers,
yellow attire and a Baijanti Mala around his neck.
He is so enchanting and plays a flute,
He who herds his cows in Brindaban,
Everyday, I will plant a garden for you,
And ornate it with flower beds at the center.
I will wear a saffron saree,
And admire your darshan.
Jogi came to do jyog.
Sanyaasi came to do his tapasya.
The monks of Brindaban came to do Bhajan.
Meera's Prabhu is solemn, be patient.
Prabhu will give his darshan,
At midnight besides the river bank.","Shyam! Keep me as Your servant,
Giridharilal! Keep me as Your servant.

As Your servant I will tend the garden; each day I’ll rise to seek Your sight.
In the groves and lanes of Vrindavan, I will sing of Your play.

In service I’ll gain Your दर्शन, I’ll gain remembrance as my sustenance.
I’ll receive the fief of loving devotion—better than all three.

The peacock crown and yellow robe suit You; on Your neck the Vaijayanti garland.
In Vrindavan You graze the cows—Mohana, the flute-player.

Green, green—each day I’ll plant the garden, and set beds in between.
I’ll behold Sanwariya; I’ll wear a saffron sari at every watch.

A yogi comes to practice yoga, an ascetic to perform austerities.
A sadhu comes to sing Hari’s name—dwelling in Vrindavan.

Mira’s Lord is deep and profound; ever remain steadfast.
At midnight the Lord granted दर्शन—on the bank of the river of love."

पद्मा की प्रतिभा की प्रशंसा सुनकर उसके पिता ऑनरेरी मैजिस्ट्रेट पण्डित रामेश्वरजी शुक्ल उसके उज्ज्वल भविष्य पर अनेक प्रकार की कल्पनाएँ किया करते हैं। योग्य वर के अभाव से उसका विवाह अब तक रोक रक्खा है।,"When her father listens to the appreciations of her talents, Honorary magistrate Pandit Rameshwarji Shukla, imagines various prospects of her bright future. Due to the lack of eligible bachelors, her marriage has not yet been done.","Hearing praise of Padma’s talent, her father, Honorary Magistrate Pandit Rameshwarji Shukla, would often indulge in all kinds of imaginings about her bright future.

"उस औरत की बग़ल में लेटकर -धूमिल
मैंने पहली बार महसूस किया है
कि नंगापन
अंधा होने के ख़िलाफ़
एक सख़्त कार्यवाही है","While I lay beside that woman

that nakedness

"नगर के बीचो-बीच

आधी रात—अँधेरे की काली स्याह
शिलाओं से बनी हुई

भीतों और अहातों के, काँच-टुकड़े जमे हुए
ऊँचे-ऊँचे कंधों पर

चाँदनी की फैली हुई सँवलाई झालरें।"," Crooked-face moon

Amidst the city
The black ink of midnight’s darkness
On the high shoulders
of walls and courtyards-, 
made up of stones,
there are cemented glass -shards
scattering moonlight's dusky tassels.","In the very heart of the city

Midnight—darkness, black and pitch,
made of stone slabs,

on the walls and in the courtyards, shards of glass set fast
upon tall shoulders,

the spread-out, dusky fringes of moonlight."

Look, the sun is setting in the west. By now its brightness has faded. How beautifully red it looks. The time of sunset is called evening.  

As you watch, darkness begins to spread. In the sky, stars are appearing one by one. Now it is night. At night, people, animals, and birds all sleep.  

On some nights, the moon can be seen in the sky from evening. Such nights are called the nights of the bright fortnight. On some nights, the moon is not seen in the evening. Such nights are called the nights of the dark fortnight.  

In the bright fortnight, the moon appears to grow day by day. In the dark fortnight, the moon appears to wane day by day. On the full-moon night, the moon looks perfectly round. On the new-moon night, the moon becomes completely invisible."
