"“बडी बेगम साहिबा!”, 
दरबार निरखून पाहिला. 
कोणी बोलायला तयार नाही - , 
कुणी आपला हात वर करत नाही - .
“मी पकडून आणतो शिवाजीला!”
बेगम साहिबा उठून उभ्या राहिल्या.
निरखून पाहिलं दरबाराला अन!
बेगम बोलल्या समयाला.","“Badi Begam Sahiba!”

Walked the aisles, scanning the court with a mere glance,
No brave ones those eyes met, none ready to take the bet,
None ready to announce - 

“I will capture and bring Shivaji!”

She got to the throne, stood tall,
With scrutiny, said to them all -","""Badi Begum Sahiba!"" 
he looked at the court. 
No one is ready to speak. 
No one is raising his hand. 
""I will catch Shivaji!"" 
Begum Sahiba stood up. 
Nirkhun looked at the court.","“Lady Begum Sahib!”,  
the court looked on in silence.  
No one was ready to speak—  
no one raised a hand.  

“I will seize and bring Shivaji!”  
Begum Sahib rose to her feet.  
She scanned the court, and—  
the Begum spoke to the moment."
"सर्वांच्या माना वळल्या.

तो चटईचा बाजूना यायला लागलाय, सर्वांच्या नजरा त्याच्यावर खेळलेल्या आहेत. 
हिरवी पगडी, पाठीमाग असणारा शेला फिरवत फिरवत,
चांदीच्या टप्प्यातला तो वीडा उचलला! आपल्या मस्तकी धारण केला!
अन काय म्हणाला - “आमीन!!! मै ले आऊनगा सिवाजी को!!!
सिवा डोंगर का चुहा, मै यू लाऊनगा!!!”
त्याच्या म्हणण्या मध्ये अर्थ होता. 
तो होताच भयानक.
","The necks turned,
Turned to the goliath - all his seven-and-a-half feet of Qad-awar ,
Chains dangling off the stature, footsteps thudding on the farsh,
Across the aisle, forth, swaggered he,
All eyes shifted:
A green pugri, swinging cape elegant,
Picked the Veeda off the silver,
The voice, now declared -

“Ameen! Sivaji will be brought.
That mountain rat, pull him out of his hole, I shall!”
","Everyone's heads turned. 
The seven-and-a-half-foot-tall dhippad - 
the foot began to roll up and down! 
He was coming to the side of the mat, 
everyone's eyes were on him. 
Turning the green turban, the shell behind him, 
he picked up the silver turban! 
He held his head! 
And what he said was - 
""Amen!!! Main le aunga sivaji ko!!! Siva dongar ka chuha, main u launga!!!"" 
He meant. It was terrible.","Everyone’s heads turned.  
A hulking man, seven and a half feet tall—  
the wooden clogs on his feet began to clatter: karr karr karr karr!  
He started coming to the side of the mat; everyone’s eyes were fixed on him.  
A green turban, twirling the shawl that hung behind him,  
he picked up that silver stand’s betel quid—set it upon his head!  
And what did he say— “Ameen!!! I will bring Shivaji!!!  
Shiva is a mountain rat; I’ll bring him like this!!!”  
There was meaning in what he said.  
He was terrifying."

patted Afzal Khan on the back,
gave him a jewel-studded sword,
granted him the Wai district, and said—
“Go!!! Bring Shiva to me!!! Alive… dead… bring him!!”
“Ameen!!! I will bring him!!”"
" “काजी साहब! सिवाजी को लाने के लिए हम जा रहे हैं, शुभ घटिका बताओ!”
 काजीन आपलं बाड उघडलं, आणि पाने चाळू लागला.

We are going to bring Shivaji—tell us the auspicious hour!”

The Kazi opened his almanac and began turning the pages.  
With honesty he told the Khan:
